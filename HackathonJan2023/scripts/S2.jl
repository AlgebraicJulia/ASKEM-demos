# Q1 *
#*****
# Forecast cases and hospitalizations for (??) model for three months, no intervention
#   Possibly modify model first
#   Possibly fit model first

#*****
# Q2 *
#*****
# Probability hospitalizations stay under threshold

#*****
# Q3 *
#*****
# Assume consistent social distancing/masking results in 50% decrease in transmission(?). 
# Minimize time the policy is in place. (Can’t be restarted once ended.) 
# From Dec. 28, what are the optimal start and end dates to keep hospitalizations below threshold over the three-month period? 
# How many fewer hospitalizations and cases are there?

#*****
# Q4 *
#*****
# Separate of Q3, sim where policies kick-in when hospitalizations rise above 80% of threshold and stop when fall below.
# Q4a) When are the policies expected to first kick-in?

#***
# Q4b
#***
# Minimize impact on transmission (in terms of % decrease) the policies need to have the first time to...
# i)  Ensure won’t reach threshold at any time in three-month period?
# ii) Ensure the policies only need to be implement once and never reimplemented?

#*****
# Q5 *
#*****
# Instead of NPIs, minimize change in vaccinations needed to have the same impact on cases and hospitalizations as answer from Q3? 
# (Depending on model, may be increase in total vax population or daily vax rate, etc.)
